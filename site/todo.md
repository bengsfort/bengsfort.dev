- [ ] Hero section interactive game.
  - This has been an idea I have wanted in my portfolios for years. The plan is to use either just canvas/three.js quads to render a 2d pixel art environment in the background of the hero. Pressing WASD would move a character that is in the scene around, where if you go to a door the hero content disappears and you have a pre-made level to traverse as fast as you can. Completion speed is saved via probably cloudflare KVS, so you can see how fast you did it vs. the averagae. Nothing too crazy, but still fun and showcasing my skillset.
- [ ] More in-depth/better contact section.
  - The current one is quite quick (go figure) and not very impressive. Would like to pump-up the juice there.
- [ ] Mobile-support.
  - During initial implementation I did not really look at the site in-depth from mobile, due to time constraints. Would love to revisit a lot of the views when I have time and ensure they are ready for all viewport sizes.
- [ ] Better typography system.
  - The current one is quite limited, and I did not think it through.
- [ ] Add 'blog' section.
  - I would love to start writing again. I need a blog to do that.
- [ ] Add an 'opinion' section.
  - I find myself having a lot of opinions, and I want to have a place where I can pick a specific topic, and then just write whatever I feel about it in a bit of a free-form way, since that does not really work with blog posts. The idea is want my opinion on a specific tech stack, or technology? Well lucky fo you, here it is! For example: common game engines, react, nextjs, build tooling (ie. vite vs esbuild), etc.
