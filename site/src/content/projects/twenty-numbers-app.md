Twenty Numbers is a mobile game that is impossible. I wanted a low-complexity project to experiment with, and after a friend showed me the twenty-numbers game I settled on this; a game revolving around trying to place 20 random numbers correctly within a list. My goal for the project was to improve my process of building and shipping React Native projects, as well as learning how to consume GameKit and Google Play Services to improve the user experience of a game with OS-level features.

The project was a success, and I feel I delivered the most polished Twenty Numbers game experience on mobile devices. Additionally, I was able to successfully bridge both the GameKit and Google Play Services API's that I needed into a singular API that can be consumed by React Native code without any platform-specific branches. I did my best to make sure each view in the app was well-thought out and highly polished; from rich transitions and animations to haptic feedback for common user actions. I also built a statistics analysis system into the app, as well as a edge-based service for customer support that allows users of the app to submit support requests that get sent and organised directly into a private discord server via a Discord bot that I developed, allowing me to have a cost-free private, secure, and fast customer support system.
