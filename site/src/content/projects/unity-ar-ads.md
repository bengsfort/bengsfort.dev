While at Unity, I was tasked with creating the worlds first AR ads. The prompt, "you're going to need to be shooting burgers into peoples mouths in a month" lead myself and a small team to developing a web-based AR ad architecture that would abide by all of the existing playable ad criteria (1 file, 1MB in size), while extending the playable ad API's to allow consuming and using platform-specific AR API's to deliver high-quality AR ads. It was an extremely unique challenge that I am extremely proud of being able to have a large part of accomplishing.

I built out the initial prototypes of a bridge that could consume native AR API's and deliver them to a webview for consumption, and then after validating the process I transitioned to a team to build the first AR ads for a number of campaigns. I architected a project template that would allow us to build these ads quickly and efficiently, having a major role in how we structured and developed each ad so that we could iterate fast and deliver the smallest possible deliverables to adhere to existing playable ad acceptable criteria. Outside of the architecture of the projects, I contributed to the general development of each playable ad, implementing things ranging from UI, interaction systems, collision detection, and general environment scripting.

While AR ads may not have gone anywhere, I am incredibly fortunate, thankful, and proud to have been able to contribute to the projects as well as create one of the first working implementations of the WebXR spec.
