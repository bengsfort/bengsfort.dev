The main driving force behind the Noice mobile app was to get the Noice experience into a native, on-the-go experience without sacrificing what makes Noice special, while re-using as much core logic as possible. I scaffolded and architected the project, settling on React Native so that we could re-use as much pre-existing logic from the rest of our stack as possible.

Outside of the project architecture, scaffolding, rounting, and fundamentals; I implemented features and provided native code support for the rest of the team. Features I touched or implemented included app authentication, home view (stream listing), channel view, live stream view, as well as all webrtc video/audio stream related implementations.
