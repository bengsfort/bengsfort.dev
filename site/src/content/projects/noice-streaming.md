Noice is a next-gen streaming platform that transforms how viewers interact with livestreams. Instead of viewing streams, they **play** the stream. Being a founder of the company, and starting when there were only 7 people at the company and we were building prototypes, it is quite difficult to pinpoint every single project I have worked on at Noice. I have been involved in every aspect of the front-end of at Noice during every iteration, and am incredibly proud to say I built a front-end team filled with the most talented developers I have ever met, as well as built the most healthy and collaborative front-end team environment I have ever had the fortune of being part of.

That said, if I were to talk about the features I fostered and am proud of, there are a number that fit the bill. I helped construct a project architecture that allowed the team to scale and share code throughout multiple clients seamlessly, as well as implemented tooling to ensure that the developer experience was as good as possible for every developer no matter how they were working. I implemented the core of the main platform, from routing, project architecture, to the glue that connects the client to the backend. I implemented the core game UI architecture as well as all of the game state syncronisation management, and all of the tooling around it to allow the team to iterate on design changes as effectively as possible. Finally, I implemented the first 2 iterations of our client-side 3D crowd rendering stack as well as tooling round it to allow our developers to iterate on the 3D environment seamlessly, and designers to see what their models will look like in production as easily as possible.

Additionally, I have also been a large contributor to the Noice tooling stack. I built a design token system that exports design variables from a single source-of-truth to both css and raw typescript (for React Native consumption), a CLI-driven bot that allows load testing of channels, chat, game, and 3d environments, dev tools game event detection, and a video annotation tool that allows Noice to visually validate, iterate, and manually contribute to game event detection.
