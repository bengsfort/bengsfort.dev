# @bengsfort.dev/eslint

This package contains the eslint config for bengsfort.dev. As I am a fan of the [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) codebase, this config is mostly just an extension of their eslint config as I think it has a pleasing code style while maintaining sane and reasonable lint rules.
